# Filename generation
###################################################

# The filename consists of 2 parts, a prefix and an extension
FileNamePattern
PREFIX EXT

# The filename prefix is described by a regular expression, 
# any leading characters are included in the prefix
PREFIX_RegEx
(.*)?

# The filename extension is .* (a dot followed by anything)
EXT_RegEx
(\..*)

# Names and Storage of scalar/vector fields inside the Ascii files
###################################################

# There are 7 different variables and we define their names as follows
FieldNames
Position,K,Pressure,Velocity,Density,Type,Viscosity

# The 7 variables mentioned above are generated by combining the following columns of the ascii data.
# * * * Note carefully the position of the comma delimiters in the FieldIndices definition * * *
# * * * Note that the position coordinates {x,y,z} must be the first field variable listed * * *
# * * * Note that for 2D data, the 3rd coordinate variable is set to -1 : it will be zero  * * *
# Position (2 components, columns 1,2,undefined)
# K (1 component, columns 0)
# Pressure (1 components, columns 3)
# Velocity (2 components, columns 4,5,undefined)
# etc etc

FieldIndices
1 2 -1,0,3,4 5 -1,6,7,8

# If a line which matches this regular expression is found, then the Time Value for the current time step
# will be extracted from the bracketed part of the expression
# Here : floating point number at start of line followed by EOL is time key
TimeExpression
^([0-9E+-.]+)$
